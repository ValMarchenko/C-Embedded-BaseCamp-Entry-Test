Given the LED V-I characteristic curve, find the value of the corresponding resistor (which limits the current through LED) to achieve at maximum 53 mW power dissipated on the LED. LED is connected to a 5 V voltage source through the resistor.

Uvcc = Ur + Ud

Ud = P/Ir

Ur = Ir*R

U = Ir*R + P/Ir

U*Ir = Ir^2*R + P

5*Ir = Ir^2*R + 53 * 10^-3

Looked at V-I characteristic, I calculated that when P = 53mW the current approximately equal to 15mA

5 * 15 * 10 ^ -3 = 225 * 10 ^-6 * R + 53 * 10 ^ -3

75 = 0.225 * R + 53

R = 22/0.225 = 98 Om
